Performance Results Between Linux and Windows

In the video I published today I compared the performance between Windows and Linux gaming using GTA V and HITMAN 3.

I was using Steam for GTA V on both Windows and Manjaro. For HITMAN 3 I was using EPIC Games which on Linux required the use of Lutris which does not have the Steam special sauce which may add more performance.
